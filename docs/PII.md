## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Information that can be used to identify an individual. Some of the PII will
allow an individual to be identified just by itself. For example passport
numbers, national Ids and so on. Other kind of PII are tied to the individual
but cannot be used to identify the individual just by themselves. For example
date-of-birth, gender and so on. Combining multiple such PIIs can be used to
identify an individual.
